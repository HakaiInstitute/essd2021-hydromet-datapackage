# essd2021-hydromet-datapackage 
This data set contains the first five water years (Oct 1, 2013 â€“ Sep 30, 2019) of continuous stream
discharge, rain, total precipitation, snow depth, air temperature, wind, relative humidity and solar
radiation records from seven hydrometric and fourteen meteorological stations for seven small
watersheds at Calvert and Hecate Islands, British Columbia, Canada. 

This dataset was prepared for publishing in the companion ESSD journal article: https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-423

All data are provided at the hourly and 5-minute timestep except for snow depth which is only presented
hourly due to the high degree of noise at the 5-minute level. The hourly rain data is corrected for
undercatch, but the 5-min data is not, also due to a high degree of noise in the wind data at this timestep.

For details on the methodology used, a selection of descriptive results and a description of the study area and general 
limitations, please see the companion ESSD journal article and/or the respective README documents found within this package.
